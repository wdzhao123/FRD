Towards weakly-supervised focus region detection via recurrent constraint network

Our dataset of DUT_FocusBox5000 can be downloaded at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yuDXfY1_KlmdXw101RSlUg Â (Extraction code: bh9v)

Instructions for the Use of Algorithms:

1. Firstly, you should download the Caffe model at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fT6zuB93wXTvF-k8qLLP7Q

2.Then, you can get the results by the following steps:

(1)demo_test.m

(2)testL0Smoothing.m

(3)bmp2ppm_for_densecrf.m

(4)crf.sh

(5)th.m

(6)The results are stored in ./test/test_final

If you want to train the model,you can download the training model at: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gEIJlD4ND5f2xiA2o5UOqw

If you would like to obtain the all results directly, you can download them at:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aQa7_jLk8SGhaNkJdaKJrw
